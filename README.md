#  Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Systems Using Machine Learning
Predictive maintenance using machine learning is a fascinating project that involves predicting equipment failures before they occur, thus minimizing downtime and reducing maintenance costs. 

Overview:
Implemented a predictive maintenance solution for industrial equipment to anticipate failures and optimize maintenance schedules. Leveraged machine learning techniques to analyze operational data and predict potential failures before they occur.

Key Achievements:
- Developed a robust predictive maintenance model using a combination of Random Forest, LightGBM, and CatBoost classifiers.
- Processed and analyzed large-scale operational data from industrial equipment to identify patterns and indicators of imminent failures.
- Achieved an accuracy of 98% in predicting equipment failures, contributing to improved operational efficiency and cost savings.
- Conducted comprehensive performance evaluations using metrics such as F1 score, accuracy, and precision-recall curves to assess model effectiveness.

Technologies Used:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, LightGBM, CatBoost, RandomForestClassifier, MultiOutputClassifier, StandardScaler

Skills Demonstrated:
Data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and evaluation, classification algorithms, predictive analytics, performance metrics, data visualization, and collaboration within multidisciplinary teams.

Impact:
This project significantly reduced unplanned downtime and maintenance costs by enabling proactive equipment maintenance strategies. The predictive models implemented are poised to enhance reliability and productivity in industrial operations.
