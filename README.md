# Predictive-Maintenance-with-Machine-Learning-project
Predictive maintenance using machine learning is a fascinating project that involves predicting equipment failures before they occur, thus minimizing downtime and reducing maintenance costs. Here's a structured approach to developing such a project



Objective: Predict when maintenance is required for equipment to prevent failures.
